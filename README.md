## Considerations

In that week when I accept the test challenge all type of problems occures in my particular life. That's not my best UI implementation and is far of stay completly implemented. But I tried to deliver the scenarios working and with at least some complete treatments and some complete test scenarios for the flows.

I apologize for not giving my best, but really a lot of weird things happened, from my son asking for my attention more than usual to food poisoning over the weekend that made my wife have to go to the hospital and didn't leave me very well.
